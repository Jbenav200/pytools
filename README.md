To be updated

### Resources

#### Online Resources
There are many great online resources for learning and improving your knowledge of python. I have listed them and some
examples below:

3. [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)
   1. [Object Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-exercises/)
   2. [How to iterate through a dictionary in Python](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/)

#### Books
There are also many books which I would recommend. Many come from the same few publishing houses and some are 
self-published. I will list the books under their publishing house:

1. Packt>
   1. [Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Python-Object-Oriented-Programming-maintainable-object-oriented/dp/1789615852/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2I6XKID2SZKPT&keywords=Python+3+object-oriented+programming&qid=1698084847&sprefix=python+3+object-oriented+programming%2Caps%2C91&sr=8-1)
   2. [Learning OpenCV 5 Computer Vision with Python 3](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-OpenCV-Computer-Vision-Python/dp/1803230223/ref=sr_1_1?crid=60IAGVOO1P9E&keywords=learning+opencv+5+computer+vision+with+python+-+fourth+edition&qid=1698084934&sprefix=learning+opencv+computer+vision%2Caps%2C148&sr=8-1)
2. O'REILLY
   1. [Data Science from Scratch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Science-Scratch-Joel-Grus/dp/1492041130/ref=sr_1_1?crid=9DU6RLVX0M6D&keywords=Data+Science+from+Scratch&qid=1698085015&sprefix=data+science+from+scratch%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-1)
3. Pearson
   1. [Software Engineering: Global Edition - Ian Somerville](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Engineering-Global-Ian-Sommerville/dp/1292096136)
   2. [Engineering Software Products: An Introduction to Modern Software Engineering, Global Edition - Ian Somerville](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1292376341/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tu00_p1_i0)

Somerville's books are more like university level course textbooks, they're chunky but thorough and worth the read.

Aside from books from these publishing houses, I'd also highly recommend Martin Fowler's books. Although he doesn't
specifically write books for python developers, I'd highly recommend his writing as he has decades of experience in
software development and his books bring an invaluable perspective.

Fowler's Books I'd recommend:
1. [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html)
2. [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)
3. [UML Distilled](https://martinfowler.com/books/uml.html)
