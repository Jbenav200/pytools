### Resources

A great resource I use to advance my python skills is [geeksforgeeks](https://geeksforgeeks.com/).
They have awesome articles for:

- [Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/)
- [Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/data-structures/)

Also another great resource I found while doing this was [RealPython](https://realpython.com/)

- [How to iterate through a dictionary in Python](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/)
